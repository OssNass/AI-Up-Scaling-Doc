# AI-Up-Scaling-Doc

Always remember, in case of disaster:

```
git commit
git push
get out
```
We will use microsoft word to right the final project documentation.

The folder `Pictures` will containt the pictures and figures of the documentation arranged by chapter, like chapter 1 pictures in `pictures/chapter 1`, while chapter 2's in `pictures/chapter 2`

The folder `Tables` will containt the tables and consequently the charts in similar structure to pictures
